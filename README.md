# Ham-burger
In the recipe we start off by adding 80% lean ground beef to a large bowl.
then we add Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper for some taste
Divide the beef into fourths, for it becoming a bit more juicy as the juice will be dripping out of each side.
Then we use our hand to form 4 hamburger patties 3/4 inch thick.
Use your thumbs to make an indention in the middle of the patties, this is for the patty to become juicy.
Grill over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes on each side, this is for a perfect grill.
Serve on hamburger buns, this needed for all the burgers.
Top with your favorite traditional burger toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, etc.), this is our choice.
